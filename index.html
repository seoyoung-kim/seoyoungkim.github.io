					<p>
						As a theoretical/empirical researcher, I am interested in how market stakeholders — consumers, firms, and the public — respond to & learn from paradigmatic changes in the marketplace.
					</p>
					<p>
						To investigate such dynamic relationships under uncertainty, I am studying a variety of substantive issues such as <i>digital transformation, brand activism, or distribution channel evolution</i> leveraging various methodologies such as <i>applied econometrics, content analysis, network analysis, and statistical machine learning</i>.

					<h1>RESEARCH</h1>
					<h2><br>WORK UNDER REVIEW</h2>
					<p>“Going Digital to Conform and Perform: Learning Logics Underpinning Digital Advertising Spending,” with Sundar Bharadwaj, under review at the <i>Journal of Marketing Research</i>.</p>
					Despite a rich understanding of how and when digital advertising contributes to firm performance, we know less about the antecedents of digital advertising spending. Drawing on the strategic change perspective, we delineate five learning logics, motivated by either conformance or performance, which explain how firms determine their digital advertising spending. A panel vector autoregression analysis complemented by a rolling hierarchical Bayesian regression approach and text analysis provides empirical evidence corroborating our theory that learning from an array of stakeholders – customers of a focal firm, peers in an industry, general consumers in the marketplace, and society – affects firms’ investment in digital advertising. In general, conformance-oriented learning logics play a more important role than performance-related learning logics in explaining digital advertising spending, which provides evidence for potential inefficiency in digital advertising spending decisions. Moreover, firms’ resource constraint perception and slack resource moderate the extent to which each learning logic explains a firm’s digital advertising spending. A non-parametric multivariate joint-trajectory clustering approach finds that firms with a learning style regarding digital advertising spending that is responsive to consumer reactions financially outperform both firms that seek to learn from multiple learning sources and firms that are indifferent to learning.<br>

						      <p>“A Meta-Analysis of Multichannel Distribution Effectiveness,” with Peng Zhang and Anindita Chakravarty, under the 2nd round review at the <i>Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science</i>.</p>
					This study is a meta-analysis based on 518 coefficient estimates of the relationship between multichannel distribution and firm performance. Integrating prior multichannel distribution literature, the authors investigate marketing-mix elements as well as customer and market attributes that influence multichannel distribution effectiveness. The analysis that accounts for firm, data and model attributes of the sampled studies reveals that firms’ multichannel distribution effectiveness is generally higher when they implement targeted communication, execute promotion-oriented communication across distribution channels, and maintain product prices consistent across distribution channels. Several marketing-mix elements’ effects are contingent on customer familiarity and market competitiveness. Further, we find that specific sequences of channel addition in distribution channel portfolios as well as particular channel assortments in distribution portfolios are more effective than others. Finally, we find that multichannel distribution effectiveness estimates in the literature are sensitive to the metric of firm performance as well as to the use of endogeneity corrections.

					<h1>TEACHING</h1>
					<h2><br>TEACHING STATEMENT</h2>
					<p class="text-center"><i>“Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.”</i> — Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p> At the core of my pedagogical philosophy is the question, “Is it relevant enough to students?” I consider teaching a process in which I help students internalize new knowledge by making their learning be more relevant to them. My approach to teaching builds on my scholarly perspective of seeing marketing as a lens that allows us to better understand what is happening in our daily lives.</p>
<p> With my passion for marketing driving major parts of my life, marketing cannot be more relevant to me. However, I understand it may not be the case for most students taking my course. Thus, when teaching marketing to students, I strive to motivate them to realize the beauty of marketing and relate marketing to their lives as much as I do.</p>

						     *in their entirety<br>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
    <p>“Professor Kim is amazing! Seriously, I have nothing bad to say about her. She’s fantastic. Always came prepared to class and encouraged us to speak up and share our thoughts. She’s a fantastic educator and UGA is lucky to have her here. Thanks for everything Professor Kim! You are the best.”</p>
    <p>“Professor Kim is one of the best professors I have taken at UGA! She is very knowledgable and really cares about her students understanding every single concept. Well organized, and lovely person!”</p>
    <p>“Professor Kim was wonderful! She is very understanding, and easy to bring up conversations with. She taught effectively and concisely!”</p>
    <p>“Professor Skye Kim did a great job as a graduate student making this material engaging and relevant to what we wanted to learn. I think her interactive google sheet with discussion questions was a good way to keep people engaged in the readings and to further their thought process on the material at hand. She also did a good job of incorporating students thoughts into the powerpoints in class and has done a good job of responding during these online classes. She has been super understanding and very informative during this pandemic process which has helped with my studies.”</p>
    <p>“I think the instructor is very knowledgeable and is very helpful. She offers very helpful feedback on our work and shares new perspectives. I like that she includes many examples in her slides as well.”</p>
    <p>“I loved this class. I think the textbook was really great and your powerpoints closely aligned with the text. I also really enjoyed how the professor incorporated real-life videos and examples into the lecture for us to further understand the material. Also, those types of examples are useful to have in our career and life, so I appreciate that there was not much emphasis on just memorizing terms.”</p>
    <p>“The instructor was really good at making concepts relatable to something that we might know outside of the classroom. She was knowledgeable on the subject as well.”</p>
						     </div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
    <p>“Professor Kim was by far my favorite professor this semester! She was a such a supportive professor and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable with the course load, and excited about the course material and coming to class. It was evident she cared deeply about getting to know each of her students and put a lot of effort into making her course interesting to her students.”</p>
    <p>“Our professor came better prepared than any professor I have ever had. She was enthusiastic, caring, and made such an effort to make sure we all knew the material before each test and by the end of the semester. She was attentive to every single person in my class. She did an amazing job!”</p>
    <p>“Professor Kim was also wonderful, always answering questions. Stimulating conversation, and answering our emails and questions very swiftly.”</p>
    <p>“The instructor did very well at expressing the material and making it easy for students to understand. I was very pleased with her and she helped me learn a lot. Would definitely take another class with her.”</p>
    <p>“Instructor was great, super friendly to students, easy to contact, and very engaging in discussions! I would definitely take another course with Ms. Kim!!”</p>
    <p>“Loved this class! Such a great experience.”</p>
    <p>“I appreciated the emphasis put on real-world examples and application. I also enjoyed the group assignments.”</p>
    <p>“I liked the use of outside media to help us understand the concepts we had to learn. The discussions we participated in were also interesting and helpful.”</p>
    <p>“The course was really well organized. I enjoyed the current event presentations and pre-class participation questions because it was different from my other classes. I also really enjoyed the videos shown during lectures.”</p>
    <p>“This has been one of my favorite courses to take at UGA, it was very well organized and taught real world skills.” </p>
<p>“The instructor was always prepared and easy to contact.”</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
    <p>“This instructor is one of the best instructors I have ever had in my 4 years at UGA. She actually cares about her students and showed us this multiple times. She was approachable and always answering questions extremely fast. I don’t think she could improve on anything that comes to mind.”</p>
    <p>“Professor Kim was fantastic!! She was so enthusiastic about class and the international topics of marketing. She was extremely informed about current events, and very helpful with the project. I would take another course with her she was amazing!!!”</p>
    <p>“The instructor was always available and emailed back quickly, which I appreciated. She really did care about making sure we understood the material and that if we had questions, they were answered helpfully. I don’t have any comments to make about improvement because I think she was an excellent professor.”</p>
    <p>“The instructor was very enthusiastic about teaching the course and was helpful and available when I had questions or issues with the classwork.”</p>
    <p>“Very sweet and asks for feedback from students and tries to incorporate it.”</p>
    <p>“You did a great job! You kept us engaged and made sure we understood everything before moving on.”</p>
    <p>“Everything was great.”</p>
    <p>“Course was super interesting and I wish there were more levels to this information so I could learn more about international business and marketing. The book is very up to date and helps me research more into the concepts were are studying. I liked the interactive group projects and individual presentation that made us research more into recent international studies that interested us.”</p>
    <p>“She did a very good job of keeping us engaged and enthusiastic about the material.”</p>
    <p>“I really liked Professor Kim. She is very kind and even knew all of our names after a week or two. I have never had a professor do that.”</p>
    <p>“I love this class! Such a wonderful professor. Cared about us.”</p>
